				<h1>Well, you found me.</h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am Dave A. Levine and I made this website by hand. I was
					born in 1999, back when the Internet was new and Windows ME
					was state-of-the-art. Since then, I've taken up the art of
					computering (yes, that is a verb now). You might find me
					crafting Web applications with Node.js, React and MongoDB,
					designing instruction set architectures and emulators in Rust,
					investigating genomic data with Python or learning an entirely
					new API or language. You may also find me attempting to
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/vmlinuz719/genos">
						code entire operating systems from scratch</a>
					depending on how much free time I have! (The one linked here is
					an early attempt; it got stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and I
					haven't felt like working on it again. Who knows - more likely,
					I'll do it over from the start.)

					In May 2021, I will be graduating from the University of Maryland,
					College Park as a computer science major.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not computering, I often play PC games such as
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.half-life.com">the Half-Life series</a>,
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/">
					Phasmophobia</a> or
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://newblood.games/dusk">DUSK</a>. I also play guitar
					- my favorite bands are Melvins, Queens of the Stone Age and pre-2004
					Ministry. Give

					<em>Filth Pig</em></a>
					a listen, it's probably their best album.
